//! Raw-store schema for the JMAP (email) provider.
//!
//! Declarations-only, proto-flavored. See
//! [`docs/data_architecture_ingestion.md`](../../../../../docs/data_architecture_ingestion.md)
//! and [`docs/data_architecture_plan.md`](../../../../../docs/data_architecture_plan.md)
//! §P0.1 for the conventions every `schema_raw.rs` follows.
//!
//! JMAP-specific notes:
//!
//! - **Two table families.** [`DATA_TABLES`] are the JMAP entity
//!   tables — `accounts`, `mailboxes`, `threads`, `emails` — each
//!   paired with a `<table>_bookkeeping` sidecar.
//!   [`JOIN_TABLES`] are the many-to-many sidecar tables
//!   (`email_mailboxes`, `email_keywords`, `email_attachments`)
//!   that live and die with their parent email's upsert
//!   transaction. The join tables deliberately don't get
//!   `<table>_bookkeeping` companions; their PK is composite, they
//!   refresh delete-then-insert per email, and there's no per-row
//!   retry story to track.
//!
//! - **PKs are upstream-supplied JMAP ids** for every entity:
//!   `accountId`, Mailbox `id`, Thread `id`, Email `id`. No UUIDv5
//!   recipes needed.
//!
//! - **Event-shaped.** `emails.received_at` carries the upstream
//!   `Email/get.receivedAt` and is the event timestamp. `sent_at`
//!   carries the message's Date header. `accounts`, `mailboxes`,
//!   `threads` are not event-shaped.
//!
//! - **Hard-delete on destroy.** When JMAP reports an email
//!   `destroyed` the row + its joins + its bookkeeping get
//!   DELETEd (blobs survive since other emails may share them).
//!   Doltlite history retains the prior state — this is the
//!   only place in the raw-store family where we hard-delete
//!   rather than mark.
//!
//! - **Blobs in the shared CAS, kind-discriminated.** The `.eml`
//!   RFC5322 source for each message and each attachment ride in
//!   the shared `blobs` table via `Email.blobId`; see
//!   [`BLOB_KIND_EML`] and [`BLOB_KIND_ATTACHMENT`] for the
//!   `kind` discriminator values.
