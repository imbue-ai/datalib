//! Doltlite-backed raw store for the `fsindex` provider.
//!
//! `open` runs the full DDL via [`dr::open`], `reset` truncates the
//! entity tables, and writes go through
//! [`frankweiler_etl::bulk::bulk_upsert_entity_in_tx`] — the
//! bookkeeping-free write path, since fsindex has no `_bookkeeping`
//! sidecars (see [`super::schema_raw::full_ddl`]).
//!
//! Branch handling: dolt is single-active-branch per connection, and
//! the sql-surface for "create-if-missing" differs across versions.
//! [`Self::checkout_branch`] tries `DOLT_CHECKOUT(branch)` first and
//! falls back to `DOLT_CHECKOUT('-b', branch)`.
//! FIXME(dolt-branch-untested-at-scale): branch ops are not yet

//!
//! See [`super::schema_raw`] for the table shapes and
//! [`EXTRACT.md`](../../EXTRACT.md) §"Multi-root via doltlite branches"
//! for why the orchestrator may checkout a non-`main` branch before
