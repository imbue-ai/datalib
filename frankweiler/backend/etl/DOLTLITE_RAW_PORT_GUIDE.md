# Porting a provider's raw store to doltlite

Reference for the pattern every provider now follows: a single
`.doltlite_db` file per source as the raw store. Distilled from the
ports: commits `5d5676d` (notion), `d0a07af` (chatgpt + anthropic +
shared utils), `815f290` (slack/bazel cleanup), `79c3b4a` (live
golden refresh), `24f1769` (bazel `.update` flow), and the
github/gitlab ports that closed out the file-tree backed providers.

All in-tree providers (anthropic, chatgpt, notion, slack, github,
gitlab, beeper) use this pattern — no more JSONL-tree raw stores.
Kept as a reference for new providers added later.

---

## End state

For a provider `<name>`, the raw store goes from this:

```
<data_root>/raw/<name>/
  some.json
  some_other.jsonl
  blobs/<id>/<file>
  ...
```

to this:

```
<data_root>/raw/<name>.doltlite_db
```

**That's it.** A single sqlite file is the entire output of the
download. No `raw/<name>/` dir, no `raw/<name>/blobs/` dir. Object
payloads, sync-run logs, endpoint shapes, AND blob bytes all live in
tables inside that one `.doltlite_db`.

Blob bytes get materialized to disk **next to the rendered markdown**
at translate time, following Notion's page-dir layout:

```
rendered_md/<provider>/<acct>/<scope>/<entity_id>/
  index.md
  index.grid_rows.json
  blobs/<filename>          # written by translate, byte-equal to the
                            # `bytes` column in the doltlite blobs table
```

The markdown link is the relative `blobs/<filename>`. A single
`<entity_id>/` directory is sharable in isolation — drop it on a USB
stick and the markdown + every attachment travels with it.

---

## Design rules (load-bearing — read before deviating)

### 1. Primary keys are upstream identifiers

Every object table keys by the **upstream provider's identifier**,
stored as `TEXT`. No surrogate `AUTOINCREMENT INTEGER`s on object
tables. The reasons (also spelled out in
`frankweiler/backend/etl/src/doltlite_raw.rs` module docs):

- `dolt diff` **stability**. Re-fetching the same upstream row must
  land at the same PK so dolt sees content changes, not row-id churn.
- **Idempotent upserts**. `ON CONFLICT(id)` works only if `id` is the
  upstream id.
- **Pre-seeding**. `(id, NULL payload)` rows must collapse into the
  same row when the detail fetch lands later. Both writers must know
  the PK up front.
- **Cross-table references** (e.g. `messages.conversation_id`) only
  mean something if they point at upstream ids.

Exception: log tables (`sync_runs`) use `AUTOINCREMENT INTEGER`
because a sync invocation has no upstream identity.

### 2. Don't use surrogate IDs for ordering either

If you need within-parent ordering (e.g. messages within a channel,
blocks within a page), add an explicit `<scope>_order INTEGER NULL`
column and `ORDER BY <scope>, <scope>_order, id`. We do NOT borrow the
PK for ordering. We do NOT use sqlite's `rowid` — doltlite hides it
(`WITHOUT ROWID`-flavored).

### 3. Synth reads checked-in fixtures; extract writes doltlite

Critical separation that prevents binary blobs in git:

- **Checked-in fixtures stay as JSON/JSONL.** Diffable,
  human-editable, no sqlite-version skew.
- The provider's `Synth` reads those fixtures and emits HTTP playback
  fixtures.
- `extract` writes the doltlite db when it runs against playback. The
  bazel fixture pipeline produces the `.doltlite_db` as an output of
  extract — never as a checked-in input.

We tried checking in a built `.doltlite_db` once. Python's stock
sqlite couldn't open the doltlite-flavored file. Don't go that route.

### 4. Journal mode DELETE, not WAL

Handled inside `frankweiler_etl::doltlite_raw::open()`:

```rust
.journal_mode(sqlx::sqlite::SqliteJournalMode::Delete)
.synchronous(sqlx::sqlite::SqliteSynchronous::Normal)
```

The raw store has a single writer (extract) and a single reader
(translate, after extract has exited). WAL leaves `<file>-wal` /
`<file>-shm` sidecars that wreck golden snapshots. `DELETE` is a
single file, byte-stable across runs.

### 5. Store payloads as raw as possible

Lesson learned on the anthropic port: we used to pre-normalize the
API response (`normalize_to_export_shape`) at fetch time. With the
doltlite port we store the **raw** response and run normalize at read
time in `translate`. That way `dolt diff` reflects actual upstream
change instead of churn from our normalizer evolving.

Corollary: stop polluting JSON payloads with downloader-synthesized
keys (`_fetched_at`, `_listing_update_time` etc.). Promote them to
real columns. This was a deliberate change made during the chatgpt
port.

### 6. Object table shape

Every object table carries the same bookkeeping columns. The shared
module's `OBJECT_BOOKKEEPING_COLUMNS` constant in `doltlite_raw.rs`
is the canonical reference. Spelled out per-table because const
concat doesn't play well with the DDL macro story:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <entity> (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                -- upstream id
    parent_id TEXT NULL,                -- if relevant
    -- ... provider-specific columns ...
    payload TEXT NULL,                  -- raw JSON wire payload (stored as JSONB; see below)
    fetched_at TEXT NULL,               -- set when payload becomes non-null
    attempt_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_attempt_at TEXT NULL,
    last_error TEXT NULL
)
```

`payload IS NULL` means "exists upstream, not yet fetched."
`--retry-failed` re-fetches rows with
`last_error IS NOT NULL OR (payload IS NULL AND attempt_count > 0)`.

### 6a. JSONB storage for payloads

Doltlite v0.11.2+ inherits SQLite 3.45's binary JSON. Every
`payload` column stores JSONB (a BLOB at the SQLite level), produced
by wrapping the bind in `jsonb(?)` on INSERT and unwrapping with
`json(payload) AS payload` on SELECT. The Rust side still binds a
text JSON string and still reads a text JSON string — only the
on-disk representation changed.

```sql
-- INSERT
INSERT INTO conversations (id, ..., payload, ...) VALUES (?, ..., jsonb(?), ...)
ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET ..., payload = excluded.payload, ...
--                                                ^ excluded.payload carries the JSONB
--                                                  through the upsert; don't re-wrap

-- SELECT
SELECT id, json(payload) AS payload, ... FROM conversations WHERE payload IS NOT NULL
```

Add a typeof() probe test in your provider's `db.rs::tests`:

```rust
let row = sqlx::query("SELECT typeof(payload) AS t FROM <table> WHERE id='...'")
    .fetch_one(db.pool()).await.unwrap();
let t: String = row.try_get("t").unwrap();
assert_eq!(t, "blob", "payload should be JSONB-encoded BLOB");
```

This guards against an accidental `jsonb()` removal that would
silently fall back to text storage with no other visible difference.

**Don't wrap** `sync_runs.config|summary` or
`endpoint_shapes.example_*` — those are tiny single-row bookkeeping
where ad-hoc `sqlite3 ... SELECT ...` ergonomics matter more than
binary-format parse perf.

Reads via `dr::load_payloads()` already unwrap with `json(...)`; if
you write a custom SELECT that returns `payload`, wrap it manually.

### 7. Blobs

Use the shared `blobs` table (full DDL in `doltlite_raw::BLOBS_DDL`).
PK is the upstream-stable blob identifier when present
(e.g. ChatGPT's `file_id`, Anthropic's `file_uuid`, Slack's
`F0...`); fall back to `{owning_id}:{slot}` when no upstream id
exists (Notion image blocks). NOT `sha256(content)` — the PK must be
known before fetching so error rows can attach to the right slot.

Trust-our-copy refetch policy: skip if `bytes IS NOT NULL`. Signed
URLs rotate; bytes don't. Handled by
`doltlite_raw::blob_exists()`.

### 8. sync_runs (log table)

Full DDL in `doltlite_raw::SYNC_RUNS_DDL`. Append-only. One row per
sync invocation. Stamp via `start_run()` / `finish_run()` so a crash
mid-sync still leaves a row with status='running'.

---

## Shared utilities — use them

`frankweiler_etl::doltlite_raw` owns everything provider-agnostic.
Don't re-implement these in your provider:

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Open DB + apply DDL | `dr::open(db_path, provider_specific_ddl)` |
| `<data_root>/raw/<name>` ↔ `<...>.doltlite_db` | `dr::db_path_for()` |
| Sync run logging | `dr::start_run()` / `dr::finish_run()` |
| Pre-seed (id) row | `dr::ensure_id(table, id)` |
| Record fetch error | `dr::record_object_error(table, id, err)` |
| Retry list | `dr::failed_ids(table)` |
| Read JSON payloads | `dr::load_payloads(table)` |
| Blob CRUD | `dr::blob_exists` / `dr::upsert_blob_bytes` / `dr::record_blob_error` / `dr::load_blobs_by_id` / `dr::load_blobs_by_owner` |
| Endpoint shape stamping | `dr::record_endpoint_shape()` |
| `BlobBytes` type | `dr::BlobBytes` (re-export from your db.rs) |

The shared module ships shared DDL constants too — `BLOBS_DDL`,
`SYNC_RUNS_DDL`, `ENDPOINT_SHAPES_DDL` — appended to your provider's
DDL inside `open()`.

Your `extract/db.rs` should be a thin provider-specific layer (see
`notion/src/extract/db.rs` as the canonical template — ~440 lines
covering pages/blocks/comments/databases/users with shared blob/sync
plumbing delegated).

---

## Implementation checklist

### Crate code (`frankweiler/backend/etl/providers/<name>/`)

1. **`src/extract/db.rs`** — provider-specific tables only. Shape:

   ```rust
   use frankweiler_etl::doltlite_raw::{self as dr};
   pub use frankweiler_etl::doltlite_raw::{db_path_for, BlobBytes};

   const DDL: &[&str] = &[
       "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <entity> ( ... )",
       "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ...",
       // ... your provider-specific tables ...
   ];

   pub struct RawDb { pool: SqlitePool }

   impl RawDb {
       pub async fn open(p: &Path) -> Result<Self> {
           Ok(Self { pool: dr::open(p, DDL).await? })
       }
       // Provider-specific upserts + state-check methods.
       // - Wrap payload binds in `jsonb(?)` (see §6a).
       // - Wrap payload SELECTs in `json(payload) AS payload`.
       // Blob / sync_runs methods delegate to `dr::*`.
   }

   pub fn block_on_load_all(db_path: &Path) -> Result<LoadedRaw> {
       // tokio::task::block_in_place + Handle::current().block_on()
       // so the sync translate path can read from the async DB.
   }
   ```

2. **`src/extract/mod.rs`** — swap on-disk writes for DB upserts.
   Standard flow:
   - `FetchOptions { db_path: PathBuf, ... }` (NOT `out_dir`)
   - `let db_path = db_path_for(&opts.db_path)` (handles legacy dir)
   - `let db = RawDb::open(&db_path).await?`
   - `let run_id = db.start_run(&run_config).await?`
   - Async work block: list / pre-seed / prioritize missing→stale /
     fetch detail / upsert payload / download blobs into DB
   - `db.finish_run(run_id, status, &summary_json).await`

3. **`src/extract/api.rs`** — transport-only. Move any
   `download_one_file` / `download_attachments_for_conversation`
   helpers out: they now write directly to the DB via
   `db.upsert_blob_bytes()` rather than the filesystem. Pattern:
   tempfile + `latchkey curl -fSL -o tmpfile signed_url`, then
   `fs::read(tmp.path())` and upsert. Errors call
   `db.record_blob_error()`.

4. **`src/translate/parse.rs`** — dispatch on path:

   ```rust
   pub fn parse_export(path: &Path) -> Result<Parsed> {
       let db_path = db_path_for(path);
       if db_path.exists() {
           return Ok(parse_loaded(block_on_load_all(&db_path)?));
       }
       if path.is_dir() {
           return parse_export_json_dir(path);  // legacy fallback
       }
       bail!("source not found at {}", path.display())
   }
   ```

   Keep the legacy JSON-tree reader as `parse_*_json_dir` so the
   in-crate render fixture test (which uses checked-in JSON) still
   works. Factor shared row-walking logic so both readers produce
   byte-identical output.

   Add a `blobs_by_id: HashMap<String, BlobBytes>` field to the
   `Parsed*` struct.

5. **`src/translate/render.rs`** — restructure to **page-dir layout**:

   - `Rendered::relative_path()` returns `<entity_id>/index.md` (NOT
     `<entity_id>.md`). One directory per renderable entity.
   - Add a per-entity `materialize_conv_blobs()` helper that writes
     each blob's bytes into `<page_dir>/blobs/<safe_filename>`.
     Filter the blobs to just those this entity references — other
     entities' blobs live next to their own `index.md`.
   - `attachment_md()` emits a relative `blobs/<safe_filename>` link
     (NOT a path through `raw/<src>/blobs/...`).
   - Inside `render_all()`, the per-entity loop becomes:
     `mkdir(page_dir)` → `materialize_conv_blobs(parsed, entity,
     &name_by_id, page_dir)` → write `index.md` → write
     `index.grid_rows.json` (use `abs.with_extension("grid_rows.json")`
     on `<page_dir>/index.md`).

   The rendered markdown's blob links change shape vs. the
   pre-doltlite era (no more `../../../raw/<src>/blobs/...`); that's
   intentional — it's part of "the only output of download is the
   doltlite db". Re-record the rendered_md snapshots.

   See `chatgpt/src/translate/render.rs` and `anthropic/src/translate/render.rs`
   for the canonical pattern.

6. **`src/bin/<name>_translate.rs`** — switch to
   `#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 2)]`
   because `block_on_load_all()` uses `block_in_place`.

7. **`synthesize.rs`** — **no changes**. Synth keeps reading
   checked-in JSON/JSONL fixtures. Synth's job is fixtures → HTTP
   playback responses; the runtime doltlite db is produced by extract
   running against the playback synth writes.

8. **`Cargo.toml`** — add `sqlx = { workspace = true }` to
   `[dependencies]`.

### Bazel (`BUILD.bazel`)

9. Add `"@frankweiler_crates//:sqlx"` to the lib's `deps`.
10. Add `"@frankweiler_crates//:tokio"` to the `<name>_translate` bin
    `deps` (it's now async).
11. Add `tempfile` to the deps of any insta-using tests that
    `tempfile::TempDir::with_prefix` (the live tests typically do —
    they only ever built under cargo before).

### Sync orchestrator (`frankweiler/backend/sync/src/main.rs`)

12. Change `out_dir: ...` to `db_path: ...` in the `FetchOptions`
    construction for this provider.

### Tests

13. **Provider unit tests** in `db.rs`: open a fresh `RawDb` in a
    tempdir, exercise upsert / load / record-error / retry-failed.
14. **`playback_roundtrip` integration test**: rewrite to assert
    against the DB rather than the on-disk JSON files. Existing
    pattern: synth JSON → playback → extract → `block_on_load_all` →
    diff payloads against the input. Has a `rust_test` rule in
    BUILD.bazel.
15. **`*_render` test**: continues using the checked-in JSON tree
    fixture via the `parse_*_json_dir` fallback. Tested by cargo and
    bazel both.
16. **`*_live` test**: must read via `block_on_load_all(db_path_for(tmp))`
    after `fetch()` rather than slurping files. Has a `rust_test` rule
    (with `manual` tag since it hits real APIs).
17. **`fixture_db_snapshot__fixture_backend_index.snap`** (in
    `frankweiler-core`): the per-conversation/page `source_fingerprint`
    will drift when you stop polluting payloads with synthetic keys.
    Re-record once via
    `bazel run //frankweiler/backend/core:fixture_db_snapshot_test.update`.
18. **`manual_e2e_live_sync_golden.snap`** + per-file snaps under
    `frankweiler/backend/sync/tests/snapshots/raw/`: re-record once via
    `bazel run //frankweiler/backend/sync:manual_e2e_live_sync_golden.update`
    (needs `LATCHKEY_CURL` set on the host — see AGENTS.md for the
    full incantation). Delete the now-orphan per-file `.snap`s that
    the new manifest doesn't reference.

---

## Snapshot-update flow (post-port)

Every insta-using test has a `.update` sibling in BUILD.bazel via
`//tools:insta.bzl::insta_update`. Run with `bazel run`, not
`bazel test`. See the "Updating insta snapshots" section in AGENTS.md.
When you add a new snapshot test in your port, add a sibling
`.update`:

```python
load("//tools:insta.bzl", "insta_update")

rust_test(name = "foo_render", ...)

insta_update(
    name = "foo_render.update",
    test = ":foo_render",
    test_args = ["--ignored"],  # if the test is #[ignore]'d
)
```

---

## Gotchas (we hit these and you will too)

1. **doltlite hides `rowid`**. Don't `ORDER BY rowid`. Don't use
   `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` as a fake rowid for ordering.

2. **Python stock sqlite can't open doltlite files**. Anywhere a
   non-Rust tool wants to read the db (the bazel pipeline's
   `run_sync_pipeline.py`, etc.), have it read the JSON/JSONL
   fixture directly instead. The doltlite db only flows through Rust
   code.

3. **WAL/SHM sidecars wreck golden tests**. The shared `dr::open()`
   already sets `journal_mode=DELETE`. Don't override.

4. **`cargo fmt --check` runs in precommit**. `cargo fmt` your new
   files before committing.

5. **`MODULE.bazel.lock`** changes when you add new workspace deps in
   `Cargo.toml`. Include it in the commit.

6. **Don't add a separate `<name>_jsonl_to_doltlite` converter
   binary**. We tried this once and threw it away. The correct
   architecture: synth reads JSONL → produces playback → extract
   reads playback → writes doltlite. The doltlite db is naturally
   generated by running the real pipeline.

7. **The `INSTA_WORKSPACE_ROOT` trap**. For new `.update` targets,
   the macro sets it to `$BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY` (the workspace
   root), NOT a crate subdir. Insta combines that root with the
   crate-relative path it derives from the source file. Setting
   workspace_subdir would double-path it.

8. **Bazel test target name = cargo binary name for snapshot tests.**
   Insta names snapshot files `<binary>__<snap>.snap`, where
   `<binary>` is the cargo binary name (= test source filename).
   When the bazel `rust_test` name differs (`foo_test` vs `foo`),
   the bazel run looks for `foo_test__*.snap` while cargo writes
   `foo__*.snap`. Fix: name the bazel target to match the cargo
   binary. We had to rename a few `*_test` rules to drop the suffix.
   For Slack specifically the slack_translate rust_binary was
   renamed to `slack_translate_bin` to free the label.

9. **`live` tests need `tempfile` in bazel deps.** They only ever
   built under cargo before, so the bazel `rust_test` rules were
   missing the dep. Adding the `.update` target builds the test —
   surfacing the missing dep. Add `tempfile` if you see
   `cannot find module or crate \`tempfile\``.

10. **Don't checked-in your fixture's `.doltlite_db`.** Run
    `bazel run //frankweiler/backend/sync:manual_e2e_live_sync_golden.update`
    after your port to refresh the binary-blob marker snapshots.
    Those are `<binary N bytes>` markers, not the actual db
    contents — the golden test deliberately skips byte-identity on
    binary files.

---

## Quick test loop

```bash
# 1. Inner-loop while writing your port:
cargo test -p frankweiler-etl-<name>

# 2. Round-trip via playback:
cargo test -p frankweiler-etl-<name> --test playback_roundtrip

# 3. Live golden (needs LATCHKEY_CURL set):
bazelisk build //frankweiler/backend/etl:latchkey_curl_shim
export LATCHKEY_CURL="$(pwd)/bazel-bin/frankweiler/backend/etl/latchkey_curl_shim"
bazelisk run //frankweiler/backend/sync:manual_e2e_live_sync_golden.update

# 4. Full bazel verify — CANONICAL invocation, matches AGENTS.md:
bazelisk test //...
```

Do NOT substitute `bazelisk test //... --test_tag_filters=-manual,-external`
here. That filter exists in some legacy notes but it silently excludes
`//:precommit_test` (cargo fmt / clippy / ruff / pyright / vue-tsc) and
`//frankweiler/ui:e2e_test` (Playwright UI suite), letting fmt drift and
UI regressions through. The canonical answer to "are tests green?" is
the bare `bazelisk test //...` line — see the "Running tests" section
of `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

A successful port produces:

- All cargo tests green
- `bazelisk test //...` green (no filter)
- `manifest.snap` collapses `raw/<name>/<files...>` to one
  `raw/<name>.doltlite_db` row, plus blob rows shift from
  `raw/<name>/blobs/...` to `rendered_md/.../<entity>/blobs/<file>`.
- `rendered_md/` paths shift from `<entity>.md` to `<entity>/index.md`
  (page-dir layout). The blob link target inside the .md changes
  from `../../../raw/<src>/blobs/...` to `blobs/<filename>`. Re-record.
- `fixture_db_snapshot__fixture_backend_index.snap`:
  `qmd_path` columns shift to the page-dir form
  (`<entity>/index.md`); `source_fingerprint` may drift too if you
  dropped synthetic keys from the payload.
- `raw/<name>.doltlite_db.snap`: just a `<binary N bytes>` marker;
  the byte count will change as you populate the new tables. Expect
  small drifts on subsequent edits (JSONB encoding, schema changes,
  page-alignment quirks) — review the size delta as a sanity check
  but don't try to make it byte-stable across encoding changes.

---

## Slack specifically

Looking ahead to the Slack port: Slack's current raw store is more
elaborate than the others. Things to plan for:

- **Multiple entity tables**: channels, users (workspace listings),
  messages (per-channel), replies (thread-children), file media.
  Current layout is JSONL events under `raw_api/<entity>/run-*.jsonl`,
  not single JSON files.
- **Conversations.list / users.list redaction**: the live-golden test
  (`SKIP_PATH_SEGMENTS`) deliberately omits these from snapshots
  because they're workspace-wide and churn on every join/leave.
  Make sure your DB-backed equivalent keeps that semantics — either
  by skipping them at upsert time or by filtering at read time.
- **`source_fingerprint` per thread**: slack's render is the most
  fingerprint-sensitive in the tree. Any normalization shift will
  cascade to all `.grid_rows.json` sidecars.
- **Synth + JSONL**: slack's synth reads JSONL (one event per line),
  not flat JSON files. Keep that input shape. The output (playback)
  is what extract reads.
- **Slack has a `slack_translate_bin` (rust_binary) AND a
  `slack_translate` (rust_test)**. Don't accidentally undo that
  split — the bazel target / snapshot file naming depends on it.

Good luck.
